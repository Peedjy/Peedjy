### Hi my name is Jean-Pierre ðŸ‘‹
I am not a professional developer and development has never been my main activity,
but my career has always been punctuated by a whole bunch of small professional and personal projects
which allowed me to acquire certain basic skills in many areas. (html/css/web, C/C++, Python, VBA etcâ€¦)
A very small part of these projects are public, but the majority must remain private because they often contain private datas.
